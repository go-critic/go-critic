* :heavy_check_mark: checker is enabled by default.
* :white_check_mark: checker is disabled by default.

### Checkers from the "diagnostic" group

Diagnostics try to find programming errors in the code.
They also detect code that may be correct, but looks suspicious.

> All diagnostics are enabled by default (unless it has "experimental" tag).

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Short description</th>
  </tr>
  {{- range .Checkers }}
    {{- if .HasTag "diagnostic" -}}
      {{ template "checker_tr" . }}
    {{- end -}}
  {{- end }}
</table>

### Checkers from the "style" group

Style checks suggest replacing some form of expression/statement
with another one that is considered more idiomatic or simple.

> Only non-opinionated style checks are enabled by default.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Short description</th>
  </tr>
  {{- range .Checkers }}
    {{- if .HasTag "style" -}}
      {{ template "checker_tr" . }}
    {{- end -}}
  {{- end }}
</table>

### Checkers from the "performance" group

Performance checks tell you about potential issues that
can make your code run slower than it could be.

> All performance checks are disabled by default.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Short description</th>
  </tr>
  {{- range .Checkers }}
    {{- if .HasTag "performance" -}}
      {{ template "checker_tr" . }}
    {{- end -}}
  {{- end }}
</table>

{{ range .Checkers }}
  {{ template "checker" . }}
{{ end }}
